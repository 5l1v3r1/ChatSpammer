Feel the sudden urge to spam someone? Are you obsessed with spamming people to irratate them? ( don't cross the line but) Great! This is perfect for you! :p

## How to use it?
Simply compile the GUI.java class, and run it! Then, and type in the info requested!

## How to use mathematical expressions?
All mathematical expressions are written inside of two `/!` strings. Example: `/! logic here /!`. The message number (starts at 0) is represented by the character `i`. 

Example: To multiply the current chat message number by 5, type in `Current message number times 5 is /!i*5/!`.
